Mongo queries in JavaScript

JSMongoQuery implements MongoDB queries in JavaScript, allowing developers to query a 'document' (an array containing data) against a Mongo query object, returning a boolean value for pass or fail.  Additionally a set of documents can be queried to filter them, as queries are used in MongoDB.

This code is used at Akkroo to allow the construction of advanced form logic queries in our web application.
